     <h1>You've arrived on Tiago's ART101 web creation homepage</h1>
     <h2>Welcome!</h2>
     <p>Hello! My name is Tiago Gideon-Silva, I'm a transfer student in my 3rd year here at UCSC. I'm an art major with a focus on printmaking and drawing.
        I'm super excited to get started with web creation and coding in this class! 
        I'm most pumped for being able to combine my own artworks with the websites we make in class, and in the process synthesize some really cool art :).
     </p>
